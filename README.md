Breast Cancer Prediction 🧠🎗️
📌 About the Project

This project is about predicting whether a breast tumor is benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous) using machine learning. I used a medical dataset and applied different ML algorithms to check which model performs the best. The aim is to show how machine learning can help in early diagnosis and decision-making.

🛠️ Tools and Libraries Used

Python

NumPy & Pandas – for data cleaning and handling

Matplotlib & Seaborn – for visualization and EDA

Scikit-learn – for machine learning models and evaluation

Jupyter Notebook – for development

📊 Project Workflow

Loaded and cleaned the dataset.

Performed EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) to understand data patterns.

Trained different ML models like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.

Compared models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

Selected the model that gave the best performance.

🎯 Results

Logistic Regression and Random Forest gave the best accuracy.

Visualizations helped to identify important features.

The model can help in quick and reliable predictions.
